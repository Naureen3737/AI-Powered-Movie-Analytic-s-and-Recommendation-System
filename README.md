# 🎬 AI-Powered Movie Analytics & Recommendation System
# 📌 Project Description

The AI-Powered Movie Analytics & Recommendation System is an intelligent machine learning–based application designed to analyze movie data and provide personalized movie recommendations to users. The system leverages data analytics, natural language processing, and recommendation algorithms to understand user preferences and suggest relevant movies efficiently.

This project demonstrates the practical implementation of data preprocessing, machine learning models, and recommendation techniques commonly used by real-world streaming platforms such as Netflix and Amazon Prime.

# 🎯 Project Objectives

Analyze large movie datasets to extract useful insights

Understand user behavior and preferences

Build an intelligent recommendation engine
